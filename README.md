# Cardiogram Connect

API Documentation and example code for Cardiogram Connect. If you're here, you're likely an integration partner -- welcome! We're excited to work with you. Feel free to email [connect@cardiogr.am](mailto:connect@cardiogr.am) with any questions.

## Getting Started

You should have received a `client id` and `client secret` from us, likely for both your development and production environments.

> Note that each client id and client secret will only work with a particular redirect URI on your system.

If you need to support additional testing redirect URIs, please email [connect@cardiogr.am.](mailto:connect@cardiogr.am)
